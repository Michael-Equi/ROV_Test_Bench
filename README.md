# ROV Test Bench

The goal of this project is to develop preseason software technologies based on ROS. This project will explorer development paths and verify new technologies before more permanent hardware development. Key areas of testing are cameras, vector drive, controllers, and PID algortihms. Additionally new workflows/integration tactics are to be tested and documented (Travis CI, Docker, node documentation, doxygen). This project will expire at the beginning of the 2018-2019 robotics season.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on the main ROV system (Master).

FOLLOW:
*  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C32ucQTIAsE2H7u9OERmmCfyc6WzUvhrB2U6_GgZuWg/edit?usp=sharing

*Always run IDE's from terminal if on Ubuntu (just type the name of the IDE in terminal and click enter ex. clion)*

### Prerequisites

What things you should to install to develop and run software and how to install them

Code Blocks IDE on rpi ubuntu mate
* `sudo apt-get install codeblocks`

On the RPI turn on the CSI, SPI, I2C, and UART interfaces using `sudo raspi-config`

Setup the I2C interface on Ubutnu Mate
* `cd /boot/config.txt`
* uncomment `dtparam=i2c_arm=off` and change to `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`
* uncomment `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=100000` and change to `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=400000`
* restart pi

Setup the ros_lib file for arduino serial
* See sketchbook README.md documentation

RPI Camera node setup
* See raspicam_node README.md documentation

### Network Setup

What things you need to do so that the ROS network operates properly

On ubuntu 16.04 go to Network Connections app and add a new ethernet connection (name the connection `ROVEthernetConnection`)
* On the topside computer have a static (manual) IP of `192.168.1.100`, netmask `24`, Gateway `92.168.1.1`, DNS server `27.0.1.1, 8.8.8.8, 192.168.1.1`
* On the bottomside computer have a static (manual) IP of `192.168.1.111`, netmask `24`, Gateway `192.168.1.1`, DNS server `127.0.1.1, 8.8.8.8, 192.168.1.1`
* Run the setupROSNetwork.sh script in the scripts folder

Once the network connection has been verified (on bottomside `ping master` / on topside `ping bottomside`)
* Run `sshSetup.sh` in the scripts folder
* Do not add any paraphrases
* on bottomside `ssh master` / on topside `ssh bottomside`
* Make sure both work without entering a password

#### Network Setup DEBUG
* IF you recieve `/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: ssh: connect to host bottomside port 22: Connection refused` go to the opposite machine from the one you recieved it on and run the following:
    * `sudo rm /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    * `sudo apt-get purge openssh-server`
    * `sudo apt-get install openssh-server`
    * `./sshSetup.sh`

* https://answers.ros.org/question/41446/a-is-not-in-your-ssh-known_hosts-file/

### Installing OS

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

On your Raspberry Pi 3B make sure you are running ubuntu mate 16.04 (image here https://drive.google.com/open?id=1497jupJ2dBQqy_o_x5JBPTjY3lto7-rI)
* cat /etc/os-release

### Simulation Setup

* See https://uuvsimulator.github.io/installation.html#creating-and-configuring-a-workspace
* Check to see if gazebo version 7 is installed `gazebo --version`
* Run `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`
* In the ros_workspace run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
* In ros_workspace run `rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y`
* Run `sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler protobuf-c-compiler`
* Connect a powerfull computer to the ROS Master by running `export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ip_to_master:11311` and `export ROS_IP=ip_of_computer`
   * Make sure the master and simulation computers can ping each other and if network problems persist make sure the computers can ssh into each other
* Run `catkin_make`
   * If you receive this error `make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/home/michael/catkin_ws/src/uuv_simulator/uuv_gazebo_plugins/uuv_gazebo_plugins/PROTOBUF_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE-NOTFOUND', needed by 'uuv_simulator/uuv_gazebo_plugins uuv_gazebo_plugins/Double.pb.cc'.  Stop. CMakeFiles/Makefile2:4699: recipe for target 'uuv_simulator/uuv_gazebo_plugins/uuv_gazebo_plugins/CMakeFiles/uuv_gazebo_plugins_msgs.dir/all' failed` then remove the /build /devel and /install folders with `rm -R` and retry steps 1 - 8
* `source devel/setup.bash`
* `roslaunch `
